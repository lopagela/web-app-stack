# Web App Stack

This repository contains a minimal framework to run a modern web application.
A 'web application' is actually a software stack containing:

* A back-end server (/API that will perform your application's actions)
* A front-end application (the GUI on which the application's users will interact with your services)
* A database (to make the data of your application persist - this is optional depending of your need)

## Back-end

python with `falcon` web framework

## Front-end

React

## Database

**TODO Build this section**
Give at least a postgres, an optional MongoDB (and a redis) would be welcome to test these software

## Deployment

Docker containers are used to deploy these different software components.
Docker compose will be used to run simultaneously and locally these different software.
